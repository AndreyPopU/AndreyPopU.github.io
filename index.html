The race events consist of transporting players into incoming traffic or activating the nitro of every player for a duration of time. Campaign mode is a prebuilt set of levels which upon completion unlock new vehicles for the player to drive. The city is <b>procedurally generated</b> and therefore can be infinite. Car traffic followed road laws such as waiting for traffic lights to turn green, or stopping before a sidewalk in case a pedestrian is crossing the road. The vehicles are able to change lanes as well.</h1>

    <h1 class="text">Unfortunately, the project slowly crumbled in my attempts to implement working     multiplayer, part of the reason being that I made the mistake to start implementing it so late into development.
